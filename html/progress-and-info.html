                            <p class="goal-text">More than half the world’s population currently reside in cities. However, cities are grappling with a multitude of complex issues, 
                                made more difficult by rising global urban poverty levels in the wake of COVID-19. From rising slum populations, insufficient public transport, 
                                city expansion outpacing population growth to threats to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services by disasters, it is essential 
                                that cities are equipped to adequately handle these challenges. As the world turns more urban, with nearly 70% of the global population projected 
                                to reside in cities by 2050, critical infrastructure, affordable housing, efficient transport and essential social services are crucial for creating 
                                resilient, sustainable cities for all. <br><br> <strong>Note: The following targets are not included in the published report: 11.4, 11.a, 11.c.</strong></p>

                        <p>In 2022, 24.8% of the urban population lived in slums or slum-like conditions, slightly lower than 25% in 2015, but higher than 24.2% in 2020. 
                            The total number of slum dwellers was 1.12 billion in 2022, 130 million more than in 2015. Over 85% of slum dwellers were concentrated in Central 
                            and Southern Asia (334 million), Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (362 million), and sub-Saharan Africa (265 million). Sub-Saharan Africa has the 
                            highest percentage of urban population living in slums, at 53.6%. Projections suggest that sub-Saharan Africa will experience the greatest proportional 
                            increase in slum dwellers, with an additional 360 million expected by 2030. This emphasizes the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to address the 
                            urban housing crisis, including providing varied housing options and equitable access to basic services.</p>
