            <h3>Urbanization across the world today </h3>
            <p>How many people are there in urban areas today? <br>
            </p>
                <p>The graphic provides estimates of the population of the world's cities and rural areas. <br>Currently, almost 4 billion people reside in cities. 
            </p>

            <p>This indicates that more than half of people on Earth reside in cities. <br> According to UN estimations, this historic event—when the population of
                <br> urban regions surpassed that of rural ones—took place in 2007.
